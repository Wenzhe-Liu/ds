# Penguins codec demo
Penguins Codec is an AI general audio codec proposed by Tencent Ethereal Audio Lab, with the support of Tencent AI Lab.

Here are some audio samples for the corresponding papers

Penguins Codec has the following features:
* All kinds of audio signals: including speech, noise and music
* High fidelity: comparable speech quality to Opus 20kbps
* Relatively low bitrate: 6~10 kbps for WB and SWB
* Low complexity and storage footprint: real-time inference in the real-life RTC software such as Tencent Meet (3A and other modules are all open) for desktop and advanced mobile phones

Penguins Codec has already been experienced at Tencent Meet (腾讯会议) for partial machine types since 2022.
